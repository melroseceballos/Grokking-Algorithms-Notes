/** Linked lists and Arrays **/

/** Linked lists are good for deletions, 
insertions, and memory saving. The downside
of it is it only allows sequential accesss
The way linkedlists works is the current data 
has the address for the next data so on and so forth
*/



/** Arrays are sub to Linked list but
the upside to it is it allows random
access so it's faster to read through**/
